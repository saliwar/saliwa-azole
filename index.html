                <p style="width:50%;">My name is Azole Saliwa. And I am a young
                  photographer, on
                  July 4 2011 my life changed forever and it all started as a
                  fun day at the beach, I started taking pictures with a small
                   cameras but I got an accident that day at the beach and I
                   broke my three vertebrae and became paralysed from the neck
                   down and I spent the best years of my life in hospital going
                   in and out of the hospital I had to learn how to walk again
                   and how to use my hands again. Photography has helped me a
                   lot to heal and recover and it has helped me to pay back to
                   the person who saved my life.and now I  work with mr Phindile
                    Khanzi and Martin as my business partners.</p>

            <h4>WEB DESIGN</h4>
            <p>Photography as design
              When I design a content-driven website that needs imagery, I turn
              to photography over illustration every time. Now, this is mostly
              because I can’t draw more than a stick figure to save my life —if
              you’re an illustrator, or have one on your team, then more power
              to you! I’m jealous.

              The right photo can take a good design, and make it great. The
              right photo can be the solution to the itching in the back of
              your brain that says, Something’s just missing. But it absolutely
              has to be the right photo.

              CONTRAST
              Because usability comes first, make sure that the photo you
              integrate into your design has the right kind of contrast. Chances
               are, you’ll be putting things like text on top of it, and there
               is nothing more irritating than text you can barely read. I’m
               looking at you, thin-white-fonts-on-light-backgrounds.

              To find the right kind of contrast, start with the obvious: if the
               photo is light, use dark text or elements, and vice versa. If you
                want to use light text with a light background, put something
                dark in between the text and the photo. A subtle drop shadow is
                usually acceptable.</p>

          <h4>Photography</h4>
<p>Photography is the art, application and practice of creating durable images
by recording light or other electromagnetic radiation, either electronically
by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive
material such as photographic film. It is employed in many fields of science,
manufacturing (e.g., photolithography), and business, as well as its more
direct uses for art, film and video production, recreational purposes, hobby,
and mass communication.</p>

<p>Typically, a lens is used to focus the light reflected or emitted from objects
into a real image on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera during a timed
exposure. With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical charge at
each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a digital image
file for subsequent display or processing. The result with photographic
emulsion is an invisible latent image, which is later chemically "developed"
into a visible image, either negative or positive depending on the purpose of
the photographic material and the method of processing. A negative image on
film is traditionally used to photographically create a positive image on a
paper base, known as a print, either by using an enlarger or by contact
printing.</p>
<p>Cameras
Main article: Camera
The camera is the image-forming device, and a photographic plate, photographic
film or a silicon electronic image sensor is the capture medium. The respective
recording medium can be the plate or film itself, or a digital magnetic or
electronic memory.</p>

<p>Photographers control the camera and lens to "expose" the light recording
material to the required amount of light to form a "latent image"
(on plate or film) or RAW file (in digital cameras) which, after appropriate
processing, is converted to a usable image. Digital cameras use an electronic
image sensor based on light-sensitive electronics such as charge-coupled device
(CCD) or complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology.
The resulting digital image is stored electronically, but can be reproduced on
a paper.</p>

<p>The camera (or 'camera obscura') is a dark room or chamber from which, as far as
possible, all light is excluded except the light that forms the image. It was
discovered and used in the 16th century by painters. The subject being
photographed, however, must be illuminated. Cameras can range from small to
very large, a whole room that is kept dark while the object to be photographed
is in another room where it is properly illuminated. This was common for
reproduction photography of flat copy when large film negatives were used
(see Process camera).</p>

<p>As soon as photographic materials became "fast" (sensitive) enough for taking
candid or surreptitious pictures, small "detective" cameras were made, some
actually disguised as a book or handbag or pocket watch (the Ticka camera) or
even worn hidden behind an Ascot necktie with a tie pin that was really the lens.
The movie camera is a type of photographic camera which takes a rapid sequence
of photographs on recording medium. In contrast to a still camera, which
captures a single snapshot at a time, the movie camera takes a series of images,
each called a "frame". This is accomplished through an intermittent mechanism.
The frames are later played back in a movie projector at a specific speed,
called the "frame rate" (number of frames per second). While viewing, a
person's eyes and brain merge the separate pictures to create the illusion of
motion.</p>
<p>Photography is both restricted as well as protected by the law in many
jurisdictions. Protection of photographs is typically achieved through the
granting of copyright or moral rights to the photographer. In the United
States, photography is protected as a First Amendment right and anyone is
free to photograph anything seen in public spaces as long as it is in plain
view.[55] In the UK a recent law (Counter-Terrorism Act 2008) increases the
power of the police to prevent people, even press photographers, from taking
pictures in public places.</p>
